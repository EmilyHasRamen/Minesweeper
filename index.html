		    Let's play a game of Minesweeper!
		    <br>
		    Click your right mouse button to flag a square
		    <br>
		    Click your left mouse button to uncover a square
		    <br>	
		    GOAL: Safely reveal squares without hitting a red mine. If you reveal a red mine, 
		    <br>
		    you lose the game.
		    <br>
			HINTS: When light gray squares are revealed, digits indicate how many adjacent
			<br>
			squares contain mines. For example, a square anywhere in the center touches 8 
			<br>
			squares along its sides and at its corners. If the number “3” is revealed, 3 mines 
			<br>
			are touching that square, along its side(s) or corner(s). 
			<br>
			HOW TO WIN: Reveal all safe squares and avoid all mines to win.

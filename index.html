	    </footer>
		    <p>
		    	Click your left mouse button to uncover a square.
				Click your right mouse button to flag a square.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>	
				GOAL: Safely reveal squares without hitting a red mine. If you reveal a red mine, you lose the game.
			</p>	
			<br>
			<p>
				HINTS: When light gray squares are revealed, digits indicate how many adjacent squares contain mines. For example, a square anywhere in the center touches 8 squares along its sides and at its corners. If the number “3” is revealed, 3 
				mines are touching that square, along its side(s) or corner(s). 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>	
				HOW TO WIN: Reveal all safe squares and avoid all mines to win.
